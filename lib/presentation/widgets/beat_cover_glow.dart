/// glow drawn inside the cover cannot escape it: the pane sits in a [PageView],
/// whose viewport clips, so the light was being sliced off flat at the pane's
/// edge — right under the segmented pill and above the transport dock. Painted
/// here it spills across the whole screen, and sitting below the shell's content
/// column it stays behind the pill, title and controls rather than hazing them.

/// mirrored into a notifier. That is one source of truth, and it comes for free:
/// the key sits *inside* the cover's beat transform, so the glow tracks the
/// pulse scale, the page swipe, rotation and the Hero flight without any of
