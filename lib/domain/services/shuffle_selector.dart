/// Two ideas shape this file:

/// 1. **Personality is data, not control flow.** Every personality resolves to
///    a [ShuffleWeights] before any scoring happens, so the scoring maths is
///    written once. Adding a personality means adding a constructor, not
///    threading another `if` through the weight function.
///
/// 2. **Selecting and ordering are the same maths.** The song that plays first
///    is drawn from the same distribution as the rest of the queue, so the
///    listener's taste governs the track they actually hear.
///
/// Pure — the only randomness is the injected [Random].
